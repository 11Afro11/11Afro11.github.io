### Education

**2013-2018**  Bachelor’s in computer science  _University of Granada_

### Experience

- #### On Going **Indra**

    Working as a software engineer creating airport simulation software. Written in C++
    and C#. Also I’ve been developing plugins for Autodesk Maya in C++ and Python.

    - Support and development of improvements in the internal modeling tool. Fixing
    some internal bugs and developing a new tool to create and assign atlas textures
    to models.

    - Plugin programming for Autodesk modeling software, Maya. Developing the
    functionality to dynamically generate geometry based on a proprietary file format, and tools and interfaces to help 3D artists to generate the extra elements
    of the airport.

    - Implementation of a new 3D tactical map synchronizing the company's own viewer tools with the .Net application to monitor pilot learning. In addition to implementing improvements and supporting the old 3D map developed in DirectX.


- #### 3 Month **Desarrollo-TIC**

    Support the applications made by the company for banks like Caja Rural de Granada
    and developing of a feature to automatically detect and translate the context of the
    webpage depending on the region using Symphony and PHP.


### Proyects

- **Facial capture.** Demo for animation using Blender software. In this demo you can animate a mesh of a face using a video as a reference thanks to a small python script to autodetect and position the bones needed to animate, as well as associate them with the mesh and apply the deformations

- **Unity Roguelike game.** A roguelike-style game made in Unity mixing two perspectives, 2D animation for characters on a 3D environment. The game is ambient in an alternative reality where Hitler escaped to space and now he tries to conquer us with his Alien-Zombi-Nazi Army.

- **OpenGL X-Wing.** Developing an interactive program in order to understand the principles of OpenGL's geometry positioning and motion scenes. This program recreates an X-Wing from the Star Wars saga that can fly, shoot and eject a cute R2D2.


- **Unreal engine Toon Tank.** A technical demo of a third-person shooter where you are controlling a tank and your objective is defeating all the turrets in the scene, as you can see in the video the AI of the turrets is so well programmed the player isn't able to beat the phase(there is nothing related to the player's ability).
